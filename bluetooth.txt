-recvBuf: pointer to the received packet from the ECGsensor
-ECGRawData: pointer to the buffer used to store the Raw ECG signal
-dwLength: length of the received packet from the ECGsensor in number of bytes.
-ECGRawDataSize: length of the Raw ECG signal stored in the buffer pointed by ECGRawData. The unit is also bytes.
-CurrentState: The State of the ECGSensor
